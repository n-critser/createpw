* creatpw : 
  A way to create passwords that uses a very advanced random number generation technique (dice).
  The program asks the user to identify the number of words desired to generate for the password [1-10]
  Once the user enters the number of random words to generate, they are are then asked to input
  5 integers [1-6] that correspond to a 6 sided dice. This technique has been well documented by the 
  Electronic Frontier Foundation [[Dice passwords][https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/new-wordlists-random-passphrases]]
